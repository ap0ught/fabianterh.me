## Background

I'm a self-driven, motivated, and independent learner who discovered my passion for programming and software engineering midway through law school. I fought to minor in Computer Science (succeeded on my 3rd application) and applied successfully to read 2 highly competitive software and product engineering modules.

In my free time, I build and maintain side projects to learn new skills and technologies.

## Blog

I write regularly on Medium. My articles have been published by various publications and distributed by Medium curators.
